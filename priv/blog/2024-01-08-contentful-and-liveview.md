## Intro

Contentful is a fantastic CMS product that allows us to create easily customizable components for our clients to be able to work
with and update their pages seamlessly and easily. Mix the ease of that with the ease of Liveview, and you have a fantastic combo that in my opinion, should give Wordpress a true run for its money.

However, with all good things, come caveats.

Contentful, gives us a JSON output of the content from the user and depending on how complex your user's project is, this can be a bit problematic.

We need to render each and every piece, not to mention any references to other components.

This article will help show and outline what needs to be done to get Contentful to work well within our Liveview application!
