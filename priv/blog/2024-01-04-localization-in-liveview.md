## Intro

Localization, along with accessibility, are two of the most commonly overlooked aspects of web development. Fortunately, as technologies get more evolved and companies more established, both implementations are starting to gain promience and importance in their implmenetation. Accessibility has always been an important topic of conversation for me, but I will save that conversation for another post. Here, I wish to talk about a relevant experience I had regarding lozalization, and how it made me realize that AI will have an ever growing importance in helping us provide solutions to overlooked issues.

## What is localization?

Seems like a silly question, but it is a topic of conversation I realize a lot of devs know about, but do not actually know how to talk about. A majority of devs are familiar with working with English, as well as their own native languages, but the implementation of other localities sometimes takes a back seat in implementation.

Most companies focus on their immmediate market, which means a narrowness in locality support.

This is understandble to a certain extent. Websites in North America look fundamentally different from those in Asia, Europe, even South America.

But there is no reason for companies to shy away from providing international support, even if those are not their target markets. After all, the only thing worse than being talked about, is not being talked about!

So, let's deep dive into what exactly localization is, and how we can make it part of our arsenal of toolkits!

(I will preface this by saying that having a dedicated lozalization team is ideal, but obviously beyond the scope of most companies. If you have the resources and capabilities though, it is definitely a recommended route)

## Implementation

TBD
